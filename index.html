What makes these giants truly terrifying is that their taste for human flesh is not born out of hunger but what appears to be out of pleasure. To ensure their survival, the remnants of humanity began living within defensive barriers, resulting in one hundred years without a single titan encounter. However, that fragile calm is soon shattered when a colossal titan manages to breach the supposedly impregnable outer wall, reigniting the fight for survival against the man-eating abominations.\n\nAfter witnessing a horrific personal loss at the hands of the invading creatures, Eren Yeager dedicates his life to their eradication by enlisting into the Survey Corps, an elite military unit that combats the merciless humanoids outside the protection of the walls.

This changes, however, with the arrival of a mysterious enemy named Raditz who presents himself as Gokuu's long-lost brother. He reveals that Gokuu is a warrior from the once powerful but now virtually extinct Saiyan race, whose homeworld was completely annihilated. When he was sent to Earth as a baby, Gokuu's sole purpose was to conquer and destroy the planet; but after suffering amnesia from a head injury, his violent and savage nature changed, and instead was raised as a kind and well-mannered boy, now fighting to protect others.\n\nWith his failed attempt at forcibly recruiting Gokuu as an ally, Raditz warns Gokuu's friends of a new threat that's rapidly approaching Earthâ€”one that could plunge Earth into an intergalactic conflict and cause the heavens themselves to shake. A war will be fought over the seven mystical dragon balls, and only the strongest will survive in Dragon Ball Z.", "animeEpisodes":[ { "episodeName":"Episode 1", "episodeSynopsis":"Sorry, this episode doesn't seem to have a synopsis yet.

After Vegeta pushes Kyabe to power up, Kyabe admits he cannot do it. Kyabe asks for Vegeta to teach him how to transform. This seemingly enrages Vegeta. Vegeta transforms into a Super Saiyan and begins to mercilessly beat Kyabe. Vegeta threatens Kyabe. He says he will kill him and destroy his planet if he forfeits. An enraged Kyabe suddenly transforms and goes on the offensive. Vegeta reveals that, since the Super Saiyan transformation is unlocked through drawing on one's inner anger, his actions were intended to bring about that transformation. Vegeta quickly powers up even more and knocks Kyabe out with a single punch. After the fight, Kyabe thanks Vegeta for telling him about his untapped potential. Vegeta brushes him off and tells him not to forget his Saiyan pride and to aim to surpass all other Saiyans. Kyabe acknowledges Vegeta's advice and walks off stage. With Universe Six now down to their last fighter, Shanpa is still unconcerned as he is certain his hit man Hit will be able to settle the score.", "episodeDescription":"Don't Forget Your Saiyan Pride!

However, Murasakibara passes to Himuro, allowing the latter to score, which surprised the Seirin team, Aomine and Kise as Murasakibara doesn't pass when having the ball. Next possession for Seirin, and Kagami becomes the point guard instead. He went past Fukui easily, and tries to shoot when Murasakibara tries to block, but Kagami passes to Kuroko and then the ball is deflected by Kuroko for an alley-oop converted by Kagami. Next, Kagami passes to Izuki, and the latter tries to lay up when Murasakibara is behind to block, but with Izuki's Eagle Eye, he lobs the ball high about and Kagami slams the ball as Murasakibara quickly tries to block the dunk. After Seirin and Yosen trade baskets, the score is now 72-68, with Yosen still leading by 4. After that, Kiyoshi returns to the court with 1 minute left. With Kiyoshi back on the team, Seirin uses the Triangle-And-Two defense, the same defense formation as in the first half. Yosen's ball, and Murasakibara attacks the rim again when Kagami had already quickly returned to try and block the former, and he decides to pass back to Himuro, who now gets quickly defended by Kiyoshi. Thinking that only Kagami can stop the Mirage Shot, Himuro goes to take one, but he got surprised as Kiyoshi did not jump to block him, but faked Himuro due to the latter's Right Of Postponement being used. Although Himuro tried to shoot as Kiyoshi did not block his second attempt, the low release point from the first release meant that even shorter players can block it, which Hyuga did block. Fast break for Seirin, and Kagami missed a jump shot, but Kiyoshi grabs the offensive rebound with his Vice Claw, then he passes to Hyuga for an open 3-pointer, putting Seirin to within just 1 point, with 20 seconds left. Now it is Yosen's possession, Okamura makes a long pass to Himuro, then the latter perfectly fakes Hyuga, and goes to shoot past Kagami, but changed to pass to Murasakibara. Then Murasakibara goes to jam the rim when Kagami again tried to block the dunk, but the dunk attempt got more powerful. Kagami almost lost, but Kiyoshi backs Kagami and the duo managed to overpower Murasakibara to stop the dunk. Seirin's counterattack, and the team got surprised as Murasakibara is already at the post defending, when Kagami, Kise and Aomine then realised that Murasakibara entered the Zone. Kise and Aomine thought that Kagami cannot win the battle if him and Murasakibara are in the zone. Knowing that he is at his limits, Kagami exceeds them and attempts a lane up, but he does not have enough space to jump from that angle, and would not reach the hoop. Kagami then made his new move, Meteor Jam, over Murasakibara, and it goes in. Seirin finally took the lead with 4 seconds left, and Himuro quickly inbounded the ball to Murasakibara, who already ran to the other side at fast speed. Kagami did not go back to defense as his energy is drained, and Murasakibara is open for an easy dunk to secure the win for Yosen, but his knees limited his attempt as the Point Guard play by Kiyoshi made him jump many times, putting burden to the knees. Murasakibara thinks that he won't miss even if he just tosses it in, but Kuroko returns and quickly blocks the shot and that's it, Seirin wins Yosen 73-72.

However, the barbecue is interrupted by a giant tree kaiju that seems to know Papi and grabs both her and Kimihito. Papi recognizes her as Kii, a dryad she had once rescued (but completely forgotten about), but Kii (who has been poisoned by the illegally dumped waste) is on a rampage with a grudge against all humans and stomps Zombina into the ground. Suu (who fell into the industrial waste) grows to Godzilla-size and battles Kii to save Kimihito and Papi; she tells them that the only way to stop Kii may be to extract the waste from her body ... which they are forced to do using a very lewd/embarrassing (but for Kii enjoyable!) method. With Kii calmed and restored to her normal size (and cleared from being the mysterious \"D\" because she can't write), Ms. Smith offers her a new host family, but she decides to remain in the forest, as long as Papi and Suu can visit her. The third \"date\" is with Cerea, who is going all out to protect Kimihito (including wearing full armor!). Manako, the MON member shadowing this \"date\" and already completely flustered by Cerea's intensity, is completely blindsided by Lilith, a devil, who looks like a child but is actually an adult and who enjoys pulling pranks on people; Lilith then turns her hypnotic tricks on Cerea, who because of earlier incidents is feeling inadequate as Kimihito's \"servant\", but the prank is interrupted by a very large and angry wild boar that attacks her. Kimihito manages to distract it and Cerea subdues it, and Kimihito reassures Cerea that he trusts her and has done so from the beginning. Cerea's confidence is restored and she is put in charge of salad-making, but Lilith, who tried her tricks on Rachnera (who had been secretly keeping an eye on Kimihito and Cerea), is caught and severely \"punished\" by the Arachne, who learns that Lilith is not \"D\" either!

First, Tionishia nearly kills Kimihito by dragging him (literally!) off to different shops, including a dress shop where even the largest size proves too small for her, but Kimihito's revealing that he can expertly alter normal clothing to fit liminals wins her over. Next, Zombina drags Kimihito off to a zombie film; later, when her hand comes off and he uses his sewing skills to reattach it, she is impressed (as well as by his seeing her as a girl and a person rather than a \"monster\") but in order to tease him deliberately detaches a breast and gets him to sew it back on as well! The last \"date\" is with a very self-conscious Manako, who becomes flustered by his being able to look her straight in the eye. The \"date\" is interrupted by Manako spotting a shadowy figure following them, and all three MON girls team up to apprehend the stalker, who is indeed \"D\" but revealed to be Doppel, who sent the first letter as a joke ... but not the second, as Kimihito finds out when a scythe is pressed against his throat by a mysterious girl with purple skin and dressed in black! Later that evening, the girls are shocked when Kimihito brings home a headless girl, totally freaking Miia out! Kimihito, Cerea, Papi, Mero and a very reluctant Miia search the nearby park where the head rolled into; the head is eventually located and actually talks to Kimihito, admitting that she sent the second letter and asking him to restore her to her body! The conversation is interrupted by the jumpy police officer, who totally freaks out upon seeing Kimihito holding the head! Thanks to some unexpected and unintentional help from Papi, the gang gets away and returns home with the head.

When Miia decides to die along with Kimihito, claiming that she cannot bear losing him, Kimihito decides to stop running away and face his imminent death, but to everybody's surprise nothing happens. Back at home, Kimihito and the girls discover from Ms. Smith that the dullahan's name is Lala and she isn't a real reaper of souls at all, having run away from several host families where she previously lived (because no one there was dying). Ms. Smith lets Lala live with Kimihito and the others by her request. When questioned about how he saw through Lala's lies, Kimihito answers that he simply realized that she has a late case of eighth grade syndrome (a quick flashback shows that he had the same thing when he was younger). Some time later, Kimihito realizes that due to the massive food bill caused by his liminal guests he is in major financial trouble and, after Miia's latest attempt at cooking ends up a total disaster, there is no more food in the house. He then sets out grocery-shopping with Cerea, Papi, Mero and Suu, and the monster girls' sympathy with the local vendors earn them plenty of merchandise with special discounts. To obtain some extra vegetables, Kimihito and Suu visit Kii, who guides them to an area with edible plants, and Kimihito learns that Suu has the ability to differentiate between fit-for-consumption ones and poisonous ones by tasting them. On the way back home, Kimihito is attacked by Draco, but Suu defends him with the poison she absorbed from the plant tasting. Once home, Kimihito prepares dinner for the girls, but Ms. Smith and the girls from MON suddenly appear to dine with them as well, completely wiping out the house's food supply once again. Kimihito is in despair, but Smith explains that the Interspecies Program will reimburse him for all the girls' food expenses ... something she hadn't told him before, to his chagrin!

Roger was known as the \"Pirate King,\" the strongest and most infamous being to have sailed the Grand Line. The capture and death of Roger by the World Government brought a change throughout the world. His last words before his death revealed the existence of the greatest treasure in the world, One Piece. It was this revelation that brought about the Grand Age of Pirates, men who dreamed of finding One Pieceâ€”which promises an unlimited amount of riches and fameâ€”and quite possibly the pinnacle of glory and the title of the Pirate King.\n\nEnter Monkey D. Luffy, a 17-year-old boy who defies your standard definition of a pirate. Rather than the popular persona of a wicked, hardened, toothless pirate ransacking villages for fun, Luffyâ€™s reason for being a pirate is one of pure wonder: the thought of an exciting adventure that leads him to intriguing people and ultimately, the promised treasure. Following in the footsteps of his childhood hero, Luffy and his crew travel across the Grand Line, experiencing crazy adventures, unveiling dark mysteries and battling strong enemies, all in order to reach the most coveted of all fortunesâ€”One Piece.", "animeEpisodes":[ { "episodeName":"Episode 1", "episodeSynopsis":"Sorry, this episode doesn't seem to have a synopsis yet.

As a car appears during Mayuri's fated time to die, Okabe attempts to change destiny by letting the car hit him instead, but Mayuri pushes him out of the way and dies in his place. After he leaps back in time, Kurisu has Okabe reveal to her that she dies in the Beta world line.

Witnessing events unfold as they did, Okabe runs into her (explaining why she claimed to have met him 15 minutes earlier when they first met) and then hides in the room where she will be stabbed. There, Kurisu meets her father, revealed to be Doctor Nakabachi, who attempts to take ownership of her time travel theory for himself. As Okabe attempts to save Kurisu, he inadvertently stabs her himself, allowing Nakabachi to escape with her theory to Russia, an event that will lead to a time machine arms race and eventually, World War III. Returning to the present, Okabe falls into despair and refuses Suzuha's offer of a second attempt. As he attempts to leave, Mayuri slaps him and tells him that he was never one to give up on someone or something. Suzuha reveals that Okabe was meant to fail the first attempt so that the scrambled video message he received on the day of Kurisu's death could be made viewable.

Finding that the liquid in the gadget has dried up, Okabe provokes Nakabachi into stabbing him before knocking out Kurisu with a taser. Letting Nakabachi escape with Kurisu's theory, Okabe uses his own blood from his stab wound and the unconscious Kurisu to recreate the scene his past self saw. As Okabe returns to the present, Suzuha gives her thanks before she disappears, as she does not exist yet in the Steins Gate world line. After he recovers from his wound, Okabe starts giving out badges to the lab members he recruited in other world lines, saving one for Suzuha, who will be born in seven years. While walking in the streets of Akihabara, Okabe reflects on his experiences and his time with Kurisu, and coming to terms with the fact that she may not remember their time together. Just then, Okabe encounters Kurisu, who was looking for him to thank him for saving her life.
